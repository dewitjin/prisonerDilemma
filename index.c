Welcome to one of the most interesting game ever. Let’s get started:

Unfortunately, the popo’s are onto you.  The popo have you and your friend in 2 separate cells and are accusing both of you for a crime.  You both did not commit the crime.  You and your friend are not able to talk with each other.  The crime is punishable by 30 years in jail.  

Now the prosecutor comes to talk to you.  She tells you she has enough to convict both of you for a lesser crime, punishable by one year in jail.  

Hang on!  

The prosecutor offers you and your friend the same deal though.  This is the deal:  
If you confess and screw your friend (and your friend remains quiet), you will go free and your friend will have to go to jail for 30 years.  If you screw your friend and your friend screws you too, however, both of you will have to go to jail for 15 years.

Urban dictionary: POPO - A Police officer. especially the ones that rides on bikes.
