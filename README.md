# prisonerDilemma
Program to teach players about the prisoner's dilemma.

## Synopsis

I didn’t learn too much in university in Economics class but I remember learning about Game Theory: an area of mathematics focusing on situations in which individuals make interdependent decisions.  Moreover, I remember the Prisoner's Dilemma Game because it explained why rational people are dumb.

## Code Example

A lot of the code in the project have been borrowed from class examples, labs, and from googling stuff.  In order for me to study codes effectively, I find it useful to actually build something fun with the code.  The code in this project is useful to start many other projects that need to display menu, ask users for inputs, do something with the inputs, and send/read emails.

TODO: send email using C

## Motivation

This project exists because I am currently enrolled in the Management of Technology MBA program at SFU.  In order to study for my upcoming final I wanted to build a game theory app.  I’ve decided to write this particular project in C (programming language) because I am also learning C.

## Installation

In order to run this code, you need an integrated development environment like Visual Studio.  This program is created using Visual Studio 2015 and started with an empty Win32 Console Application.


In order to run the code, fork the repo and run.  After answering some questions, the application should send out an email to you friend.  The email will tell your friend about the situation and request an answer.  

TODO: I may leave this out. Note: I’ve requested that your friend should reply by clicking the reply all option - in order for me to be able to keep track of your friends reply.  In order to keep track of the game results, I will monitor the the email that I have created for this game and use your friend's email to update the text file on this project with it. 

The email that will be sent out to your friend will look like this:
